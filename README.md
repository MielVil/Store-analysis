# Store_analysis
This project is part of the Alura Latam challenges. In this analysis, I evaluated four stores to determine which ones generate the highest revenue and which one should potentially be closed.

To choose the store to close, I first explored the general structure of the dataframe, checked the data types of each column, and reviewed the content of the variables. Then, I analyzed trends and customer segments to understand each store's individual profit and costs. Finally, I created visualizations to support the analysis.

## 1. Billing analysis


## 2. Sales by product category
## 3. Average store rating
### 3.1 Average rating over time
## 4. Best-selling and least-selling products
## 5. Average shipping costs per store
## 6. Total profit
## 7. Visualizations
## Summary and conclusions
